# Efficient fair PCA for fair representation learning

This repository contains code for our AISTATS 2023 paper [Efficient fair PCA for fair representation learning](http://aistats.org/aistats2023/accepted.html).

## Preparations

* Install all required packages as specified in `requirements.txt`.

* Set the project root directory as your working directory.

* Download the code provided by [Lee et al. (2022)](https://github.com/nick-jhlee/fair-manifold-pca) by running
   `git clone https://github.com/nick-jhlee/fair-manifold-pca.git`. Their code requires Matlab
   and R, and since our code is built on theirs, so does ours.

* Download the code provided by [Ravfogel et al. (2020)](https://github.com/shauli-ravfogel/nullspace_projection) by running
   `git clone https://github.com/shauli-ravfogel/nullspace_projection.git`. Change Line 5 in
   `nullspace_projection/src/debias.py` from **from src import classifier** to
   **from nullspace_projection.src import classifier**.

* Download the code provided by [Ravfogel et al. (2022)](https://github.com/shauli-ravfogel/rlace-icml) by running
   `git clone https://github.com/shauli-ravfogel/rlace-icml.git`. Rename the folder **rlace-icml** to
   **rlace_icml**.

* Download some of the code provided by Samadi et al. (2018) by running 
```
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/samirasamadi/Fair-PCA/master/optApprox.m -P experiment_as_in_Lee_real_data
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/samirasamadi/Fair-PCA/master/mw.m -P experiment_as_in_Lee_real_data
```

* Download the [Adult Income](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/adult) and the [Bank Marketing](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/bank+marketing) dataset from the UCI repository to the folder `comparison_with_Agarwal` by running, from within that folder,
```
wget https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/adult/adult.data
wget https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/adult/adult.test
wget https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/00222/bank-additional.zip
unzip bank-additional.zip
``` 
* Delete the first row of the adult.test file.
 

 
## Running the code

* In order to produce the plots of Figure 1, from the project root directory run `illustration_Figure1/illustration_Figure1.py`.

* In order to produce the plots in Figures 3 & 4, from the project root directory first run `experiment_as_in_Lee_synthetic_data/experiment_as_in_Lee_synthetic_data.py`,
   then `experiment_as_in_Lee_synthetic_data/analysis.m`, and finally
   `experiment_as_in_Lee_synthetic_data/boxplot.R`.

* In order to produce the results of Tables 1 to 3, from the project root directory first run `experiment_as_in_Lee_real_data/experiment_as_in_Lee_real_data.py`,
   then `experiment_as_in_Lee_real_data/analysis.m`, then
   `experiment_as_in_Lee_real_data/MLP_analysis.py`, and finally
   `experiment_as_in_Lee_real_data/write_results.py`.

* In order to produce the plots of Figures 4 & 8, from the project root directory
 run `comparison_with_Agarwal/comparison_with_Agarwal.py`. Change the parameters in 
   Lines 24 - 29 depending on which plots you want to create.
